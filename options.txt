✅ 1. How to Create a New Web Page in Joomla
this i used for the pages of ww1 and ww2.

In Joomla, a “page” is typically created by creating an article or using a component view, and linking it to a menu item.

Option A: Create a Simple Page with an Article
Go to Content > Articles > + New

Title it (e.g., “Special Projects”)

Add your content (text, images, HTML, etc.)

Set Status to Published

Click Save & Close

Now the article exists — but it’s not linked anywhere yet. That’s step 2.

✅ 2. How to Add a Menu Header That Links to the Page
Go to Menus > Main Menu > + New

Menu Title: What users will see (e.g., “Special Projects”)

Menu Item Type:

Click Select

Choose Articles > Single Article

Select Article: Choose the one you just created

Set Status to Published

Click Save & Close

💡 It’ll now appear in the top nav bar unless your template suppresses it or you’re using a menu override.
